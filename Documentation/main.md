# main.py Explanation

This section provides an explanation of the `main.py` script, which serves as the entry point for your Docker container. The script determines the environment and mode of operation and runs the appropriate Python script based on these settings.

## Overview

The `main.py` script performs the following key tasks:
1. Retrieves environment variables to determine the mode of operation and the environment.
2. Sets the paths for the training and inference scripts based on the environment.
3. Executes the appropriate script (training or inference) based on the mode.

### Script Breakdown

```python
import subprocess
import os
```

- **import subprocess**: This module is used to run new applications or programs through Python code.
- **import os**: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system and retrieve environment variables.

```python
def main():
    environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "local")
    mode = os.getenv("MODE", "train")
```

- **environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "local")**: Retrieves the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. If it's not set, defaults to `"local"`.
- **mode = os.getenv("MODE", "train")**: Retrieves the `MODE` environment variable. If it's not set, defaults to `"train"`.

```python
    train_path = "/opt/ml/code/train.py"
    inference_path = "/opt/ml/code/inference.py"

    if environment == "local":
        train_path = "train.py"
        inference_path = "inference.py"
```

- **train_path = "/opt/ml/code/train.py"**: Sets the default path for the training script.
- **inference_path = "/opt/ml/code/inference.py"**: Sets the default path for the inference script.
- **if environment == "local"**: Adjusts the paths for local execution.

```python
    if mode == "train":
        subprocess.run(["python", train_path])
    elif mode == "inference":
        subprocess.run(["python", inference_path])  # Placeholder for inference script
```

- **if mode == "train"**: If the mode is `"train"`, it runs the training script.
- **elif mode == "inference"**: If the mode is `"inference"`, it runs the inference script. Note that the inference functionality is currently a placeholder.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- **if __name__ == "__main__"**: This ensures that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed directly.

## How to Use

1. **Setting Environment Variables**:
   - **ENVIRONMENT**: Determines where the script is running. It can be set to `"local"` for local development or `"cloud"` for deployment in a cloud environment.
   - **MODE**: Specifies the mode of operation. It can be set to `"train"` to run the training script or `"inference"` to run the inference script.

2. **Running the Script**:
   - The script will automatically execute the appropriate Python script based on the environment and mode.

### Example Commands

- **Local Training**:
  ```sh
  ENVIRONMENT=local MODE=train python main.py
  ```

- **Cloud Inference**:
  ```sh
  ENVIRONMENT=cloud MODE=inference python main.py
  ```

### Integrating with Docker

When using Docker, the environment variables are set in the Dockerfile and can also be overridden at runtime using the `-e` flag.

- **Docker Run Example**:
  ```sh
  docker run -e MODE=train -e ENVIRONMENT=cloud my_mlops_image
  ```

By following this guide, you can understand the purpose of each part of the `main.py` script and how to configure and run it in different environments.
