# main.py Explanation

This section provides an explanation of the `main.py` script, which serves as the entry point for your Docker container. The script determines the environment and mode of operation and runs the appropriate Python script based on these settings.

## Overview

The `main.py` script performs the following key tasks:
1. Retrieves environment variables to determine the mode of operation and the environment.
2. Sets the paths for the training and inference scripts based on the environment.
3. Executes the appropriate script (training or inference) based on the mode.

### Script Breakdown

- **import subprocess**: This module is used to run new applications or programs through Python code.
- **import os**: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system and retrieve environment variables.
```python
import subprocess
import os
```

- **environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "local")**: Retrieves the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. If it's not set, defaults to `"local"`.
- **mode = os.getenv("MODE", "train")**: Retrieves the `MODE` environment variable. If it's not set, defaults to `"train"`.
```python
def main():
    environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "local")
    mode = os.getenv("MODE", "train")
```

- **train_path = "/opt/ml/code/train.py"**: Sets the default path for the training script.
- **inference_path = "/opt/ml/code/inference.py"**: Sets the default path for the inference script.
- **if environment == "local"**: Adjusts the paths for local execution.
```python
    train_path = "/opt/ml/code/train.py"
    inference_path = "/opt/ml/code/inference.py"

    if environment == "local":
        train_path = "train.py"
        inference_path = "inference.py"
```

- **if mode == "train"**: If the mode is `"train"`, it runs the training script.
- **elif mode == "inference"**: If the mode is `"inference"`, it runs the inference script. Note that the inference functionality is currently a placeholder.
```python
    if mode == "train":
        subprocess.run(["python", train_path])
    elif mode == "inference":
        subprocess.run(["python", inference_path])  # Placeholder for inference script
```

- **if __name__ == "__main__"**: This ensures that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed directly.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
