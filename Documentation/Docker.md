# Dockerfile Explanation

This Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for running Python scripts with specific dependencies. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the contents of the Dockerfile:

### Base Image

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim
```

- **FROM python:3.8-slim**: This line specifies the base image for the Docker container. It uses a lightweight version of Python 3.8, which is suitable for building a minimal and efficient container.

### Install Necessary Libraries

```Dockerfile
RUN pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

- **RUN pip install pandas scikit-learn**: This command installs the necessary Python libraries, `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, which are essential for data manipulation and machine learning tasks, respectively.

### Set Environment Variables

```Dockerfile
ENV MODE="train"
ENV ENVIRONMENT="cloud"
```

- **ENV MODE="train"**: Sets an environment variable `MODE` with the value `train`. This variable can be used within your scripts to determine the mode of operation.
- **ENV ENVIRONMENT="cloud"**: Sets an environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` with the value `cloud`. This variable can be used to specify the environment in which the container is running.

### Copy Your Scripts

```Dockerfile
COPY train.py /opt/ml/code/train.py
COPY inference.py /opt/ml/code/inference.py 
COPY main.py /opt/ml/code/main.py
```

- **COPY train.py /opt/ml/code/train.py**: Copies the `train.py` script from your local machine to the specified directory within the container.
- **COPY inference.py /opt/ml/code/inference.py**: Copies the `inference.py` script to the same directory.
- **COPY main.py /opt/ml/code/main.py**: Copies the `main.py` script to the same directory. This script will serve as the entry point for the container.

### Define the Entry Point

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/opt/ml/code/main.py"]
```

- **ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/opt/ml/code/main.py"]**: This line defines the entry point for the Docker container. When the container starts, it will run the `main.py` script using Python.

### How to Build and Run the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

   - This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as `my-python-app`.
2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```sh
   docker run -e MODE=train -e ENVIRONMENT=cloud my-python-app
   ```

   - This command runs the Docker container based on the `my-python-app` image. The `-e` options set the `MODE` and `ENVIRONMENT` environment variables, which can be accessed within your scripts.

By following these steps, you can create a Docker container that encapsulates your Python environment and scripts, making it easy to deploy and run your application consistently across different environments.
